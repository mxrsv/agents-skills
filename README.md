# Agents & Skills

A personal set of **custom agents** and **skills** for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), built up through daily use. This repo is a public backup — it contains no sessions, memory, or sensitive config (see `.gitignore`).

## Structure

```
agents/     — specialized subagents (review, planning, research...)
skills/     — skills invokable via the Skill tool or slash commands
commands/   — custom slash commands
rules/      — coding style / patterns, per-language or shared
```

## Usage

Copy the folders you want into `~/.claude/` (global) or `.claude/` inside a project (local):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mxrsv/agents-skills.git
cp -r agents-skills/agents   ~/.claude/agents
cp -r agents-skills/skills   ~/.claude/skills
cp -r agents-skills/commands ~/.claude/commands
cp -r agents-skills/rules    ~/.claude/rules
```

Claude Code automatically discovers agents (via the `Agent` tool) and skills (via the `Skill` tool) from the `description` in each file's frontmatter — no extra configuration needed.

## Rules

- `rules/context7.md` — always prefer looking up docs via the Context7 MCP when working with libraries/frameworks
- `rules/common/` — coding style, React patterns, and general patterns shared across languages
- `rules/typescript/` — coding style and patterns specific to TypeScript
